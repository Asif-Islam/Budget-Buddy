# Budget-Buddy
AppJam 2015 submission

This is my submission for AppJam 2015 with my Windows Phone App called Budget Buddy.
The relevant code that the judges will want to look at will be found under Budgeting --> Budgeting
Classes have been split into "Converters", "Models", and  "ViewModels"
The "Views" Folder contains both the XAML Code as well as the accompanying c# code
